new work:
A Full LanM protein sequence is arranged into these nine fragments
Head + EF1 + Linker1 + EF2 + Linker2 + EF3 + Linker3 + EF4 + Tail
Aim for this phase: To design shorter sequences which contain two EF hands only, and let RFDiffusion design the linkers, head, and tail
We will call the shorter sequences with 2 hands hereafter as: HalfDesigns
From the list of individual hands whose energies you have measured in the excel above - note that the ones with more negative energies are more stable.
Pick the top 15 most stable EF2 hands, top 15 EF3 hands, top 5 EF1 hands, top 5 EF4 hands - ignore rest
For the 2H designs make all possibilities for all the following five cases
Case 1:  Head + EF2 + Linker2 + EF3 + Tail  (Head and Linker 2 should come from the original LanM sequence where EF2 comes from ; Tail comes from the original LanM sequence where EF3 comes from) (225 cases)
Case 2: Head + EF1 + Linker1 + EF2 + Tail (same logic follows for choosing Head, Linker1, and Tail) (75 cases)
Case 3: Head + EF4 + Linker1 + EF2 + Tail (75 cases)
Case 4: Head + EF1 + Linker1 + EF3 + Tail (75 cases)
Case 5: Head + EF4 + Linker1 + EF3 + Tail (75 cases)
This will give you - Total 525 cases = 225 + (75x5)
Make these mutant sequences using PyRosetta and energy minimize them
We will take top 10  HalfDesigns for each of the 5 Cases based on the lowest energies Total 50 designs
Run RFDiffusion on these 50 sequences and design 10 sequences from each - where the head, linkers, and tail are allowed to vary. The EF hand sequences should remain fixed.
First get to Step 6, and then we should meet, and then let's run Step7
Please make a folder in Cybox inside our group folder and keep storing all results in proper subfolders and may be a doc file with these instructions that I sent and wherever you are at. Put a check mark on that doc for things that get done.
